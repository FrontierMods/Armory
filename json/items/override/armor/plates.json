    "description": "A polygonal ballistic plate with a slightly concave profile, made of alumina (ballistic ceramic).  Its inner surface is covered with UHMWPE and is labeled \"TOP\", while the outward-facing surface is labeled \"STRIKE FACE\".  This plate is rated for NIJ III+, which means it's been tested to survive at least 3 rounds of high-energy rifle rounds, and then some.  Plates like this one are intended to be inserted into a plate carrier where it will absorb the energy of multiple rifle rounds before requiring replacement.  This model is sized \"medium\" and can only fit in carriers that allow medium-sized plates.",
