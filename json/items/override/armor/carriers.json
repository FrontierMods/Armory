It features a large, thin laser-cut cummerbund, reinforced pocket stitching, and two Velcro panels.  The larger panel, along with QASM buckles above it, can be used to attach a QASM placard.  The smaller panel could be used for decorative patches.  The LPSPC is designed for use with medium-sized ballistic plates, and will accept one in any weight or material, though thinner plates are recommended for comfort.",
