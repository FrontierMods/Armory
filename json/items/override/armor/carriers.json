Intended as an alternative to the heavier, larger IOTV, the SPCS is more comfortable to wear, in exchange for lower body coverage.  The SPCS was designed for shorter missions and those where heavy gunfire is not expected.  It offers a good amount of PALS webbing on the front and the back.  This particular model comes without cummerbunds or side plate pouches, with plain nylon straps connecting front and back plate carriers.",
