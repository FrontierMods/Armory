PALS webbing on the outer belt allows attaching MOLLE pouches, and the belt itself can support tactical belt accessories.  Additionally, this belt can support up to two large or leg-strapped pieces of gear attached to it.  It is designed to be worn as support for a pair of pants, but can be worn separately.",
