    "description": "A full-cut ballistic plate with slightly clipped corners and a single-curve profile, made of alumina and wrapped in UHMWPE. Manufacturer's logo is proudly displayed on the outward-facing side.  This plate is rated for NIJ IV, which means it's been tested to survive at least 3 rounds of armor-piercing high-energy rifle rounds: some of the most dangerous rounds out there.  Plates like this one are intended to be inserted into a plate carrier where it will absorb the energy of multiple rifle rounds before requiring replacement.  This model is a 6″×6″ side panel and can only fit in side panel pouches on a plate carrier.",
