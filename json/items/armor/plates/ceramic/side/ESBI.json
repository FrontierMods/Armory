This plate has been certified ESBI, which is comparable with the civilian NIJ IV rating.  Plates like this one are intended to be inserted into a plate carrier, where it will absorb the energy of multiple rifle rounds before requiring replacement.  On the front, it says <color_yellow>\nSTRIKE FACE\nHANDLE WITH CARE</color>\nOn the back, it says <color_yellow>\nESBI GEN II</color>, as well as the name of the manufacturer -- Leading Technology Composites, Inc. -- and its NSN.",
