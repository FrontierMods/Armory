This plate has been certified ESAPI, which is comparable with the civilian NIJ IV rating.  Plates like this one are intended to be inserted into a plate carrier, where it will absorb the energy of multiple rifle rounds before requiring replacement.  On the front, it says <color_yellow>\nMEDIUM\nSTRIKE FACE\nHANDLE WITH CARE</color>\nOn the back, it says <color_yellow>\nTOP\n7.62 mm APM2 PROTECTION\nU.S.</color>, as well as the name of the manufacturer -- Ceradyne, Inc. -- and its NSN.",
