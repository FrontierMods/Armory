Made of a proprietary synthetic fabric that's breathable and flame-resistant, this model had been issued to Army soldiers as part of the standard uniform prior to the Cataclysm.  Designed primary for hot-weather conditions, it holds its own well in milder weather.  Has a small pocket on each sleeve, and two slots for pens on the left sleeve.",
