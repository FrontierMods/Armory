    "description": "A no-nonsense tactical backpack, with a total capacity of 39 liters.  Like in many other 5.11 Tactical packs, the number in the name comes from the amount of hours the user is expected to last with supplies packed in the available space.  Simple clamshell storage, a mesh divider for access to a smaller storage, laptop sleeve in the back, and an admin pouch at the top.  The MOLLE webbing provides plenty of space for additional pouches.  The velcro patch surface could be used for decorative and informatonal patches.",
