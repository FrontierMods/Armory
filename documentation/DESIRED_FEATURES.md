# Desired Features

You can help the mod by implementing the following features for the next stable release.

## Overcapacity

**TL;DR**: allow containers to support more weight/volume/length than they're rated for, in exchange for tangible negatives.

[proper outline TBD]

## Volume calculation from dimensions

**TL;DR**: allow initial volume and longest-side values to be calculated from a provided `dimensions` object (or an array of objects).

[proper outline TBD]

## Surface-area-based pocket restrictions

**TL;DR**: allow pockets to be surfaces, and calculate restrictions based on items' `dimensions`.

[proper outline TBD]

## Whitelisted gunmods

**TL;DR**: some holsters should allow guns with certain (classes of) gunmods to be put inside by discounting their volume and length (but not weight) for volume/length restriction calculations.

[proper outline TBD]

## Required gunmods for holsters

**TL;DR**: certain holsters are built to latch onto specific models of gunmods. Guns without these gunmods cannot be allowed into the holster (while also respecting other restrictions).
