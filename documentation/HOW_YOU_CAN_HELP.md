# How You Can Help

While this mod's development is self-sufficient enough – in that it doesn't require a group of people to support it – there are ways you can help make the process easier. None of this is required, requested, or asked of you; do this only if you find it to be worth your time.

## Implement Desired Features

One way you can help is by implementing any of the features listed below. Having these features in the next stable would either make development easier or allow implementing new features for the mod.

See [`DESIRED_FEATURES.md`](./DESIRED_FEATURES.md) for the list of features, the description of their nature, and a proposed implementation.

## Provide Graphics Support

This mod doesn't feature any graphics for its contents, due to a lack of expertise with tilesets. Graphics provide immersiveness; that's more so important for mods that aim to ground the game further in reality.

If you're an artist, you can help by adding tileset support for the mod. Reference images can usually be found in sources listed in the JSON of each item. Should you need assistance with finding a better reference image, it could be provided if you create a discussion with a `Request` tag.

## Donate

This mod takes time and effort to make work. It isn't necessary to support it financially – it is, after all, a hobby project made by an enthusiast – but should you feel the desire, the [_Core_ mod](https://github.com/FrontierMods/Core) has a list of links where you can donate to support the project.

(Bear in mind that a donation does not, in itself, solicit an expedited feature request. Donate only if you feel like supporting the mods as they are.)
