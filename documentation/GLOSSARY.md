## Materials

<dl>
	<dt>aramid fabric</dt>
	<dd>A synthetic fiber that, much like plastic, has a multitude of uses. Some of the aramid fabrics have heat-resistance properties and are used in heat- and fire-resistant clothing, such as those used by firefighters. Other aramids have strength-to-weight ratio, and are thus used in soft body armor. Aramid-based ballistic fabrics, such as KevlarÂ®, can stop threats up to NIJ IIIA.</dd>
	<dt>Kevlar</dt>
	<dd>Brand name for a type of aramid fabrics. Primarily known for being used in ballistic vests, as well as generally in bullet-resistant clothing, its physical properties allow it to be resistant to abrasion, high temperatures, and acids. Its light weight and flexibility make it a popular material for use in body armors intended to resist pistol-caliber rounds; however, it is not as effective against rifle bullets. Kevlar is difficult to produce due to the chemical processes required to synthesize it. Once synthesized, it suffers severely when exposed to UV light, which is the reason non-ballistic layers are required to cover it.</dd>
