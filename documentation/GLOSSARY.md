## Materials

<dl>
	<dt>aramid fabric</dt>
	<dd>A synthetic fiber that, much like plastic, has a multitude of uses. Some of the aramid fabrics have heat-resistance properties and are used in heat- and fire-resistant clothing, such as those used by firefighters. Other aramids have strength-to-weight ratio, and are thus used in soft body armor. Aramid-based ballistic fabrics, such as KevlarÂ®, can stop threats up to NIJ IIIA.</dd>
	<dt>Kevlar</dt>
	<dd>Brand name for a type of aramid fabrics. Primarily known for being used in ballistic vests, as well as generally in bullet-resistant clothing, its physical properties allow it to be resistant to abrasion, high temperatures, and acids. Its light weight and flexibility make it a popular material for use in body armors intended to resist pistol-caliber rounds; however, it is not as effective against rifle bullets. Kevlar is difficult to produce due to the chemical processes required to synthesize it. Once synthesized, it suffers severely when exposed to UV light, which is the reason non-ballistic layers are required to cover it.</dd>

## Armor & Protection

### Modular equipment interfaces

<dl>
	<dt>PALS</dt>
	<dd>An interface between modular equipment (such as tactical pouches) to an item of clothing (such as a load-bearing vest or a plate carrier).  PALS stands for Pouch Attachment Ladder System, where the "ladder" is the aforementioned webbing. The system was developed by the US Army to enable carrying a new generation of modular equipment, such as MOLLE. Attachment is fasciliated with the straps on the attached equipment wrapping under the webbing, with (most often) snap buttons allowing the strap to hold the attached equipment in place</dd>
    <dt>MOLLE</dt>
    <dd>A system of modular equipment used by the US Army. The list of equipment includes a number of pouches and a large variety of specialized pouches. MOLLE equipment uses PALS to marry the two components together. At present, "MOLLE" is used to generally refer to modular equipment that uses PALS, as the model of attachment has gained persistent popularity in the civilian market.</dd>
    <dt>QASM</dt>
    <dd>An interface for attaching panels or placards to a larger piece (such as a plate carrier) or a harness (for wearing without the extra protection). QASM stands for Quick Attach Surface Mount. The mounting is fascilitated with plastic buckles, which make the process quick.</dd>
