	<dt>aramid fabric</dt>
	<dd>A synthetic fiber that, much like plastic, has a multitude of uses. Some of the aramid fabrics have heat-resistance properties and are used in heat- and fire-resistant clothing, such as those used by firefighters. Other aramids have strength-to-weight ratio, and are thus used in soft body armor. Aramid-based ballistic fabrics, such as KevlarÂ®, can stop threats up to NIJ IIIA.</dd>
