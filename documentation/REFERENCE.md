# Reference & Notes

## Ballistic Armor

### Ballistic Plates

#### Cut

**Full cut**: an (almost) rectangular cut with rounded or slightly-clipped corners. Usually reserved for back and side plates. Provides the most coverage. Most plate carriers do not allow putting a full-cut plate in the front due to their design.

**SAPI cut**: standard way to cut ballistic plates. Used by military plates. Top corners are clipped at a 45Â° angle.

**Shooter cut** (also: **shooter's cut**): similar to SAPI cut, but with the bottom corners also clipped (to a smaller degree). Trades off a bit of coverage for a bit of increased mobility overall.

**Swimmer cut**: a cut with a sharper angle for top corner clipping. Trades off some coverage for increased shoulder/arm mobility.

#### Curvature

**Single-curve**: standard curvature of a ballistic plate. Relatively-cheap to produce.

**Multi-curve**: advanced curvature. Fits better with the body, removing hot spots and reducing discomfort.
