# Reference & Notes

## Ballistic Armor

### Ballistic Plates

#### Coverage

Coverage is roughly divided between front/back and side plates. Front/back plates can only cover up to 80% of the torso. Side plates, therefore, can only cover up to 20%. With that in mind, visual reference of coverage area is multiplied by these modifiers in order to get the final value.

**Front / Back plates**:

- **SAPI small plate**: 38% (×80% → 30%) upper torso coverage + 10% (×80% → 08%) lower torso coverage
- **SAPI medium plate**: 42% (×80% → 34%) upper torso coverage + 12% (×80% → 10%) lower torso coverage
- **SAPI large plate**: 45% (×80% → 36%) upper torso coverage + 16% (×80% → 13%) lower torso coverage
- **SAPI XL plate**: 48% (×80% → 38%) upper torso coverage + 20% (×80% → 16%) lower torso coverage

**Side plates**:

- **6 × 6 in. plate**: 00% (×20% → 00%) upper torso coverage + 25% (×20% → 05%) lower torso coverage
- **6 × 8 in. plate** (aka **tall side plate**): 12% (×20% → 02%) upper torso coverage + 25% (×20% → 05%) lower torso coverage

#### Cut

**Full cut**: an (almost) rectangular cut with rounded or slightly-clipped corners. Usually reserved for back and side plates. Provides the most coverage. Most plate carriers do not allow putting a full-cut plate in the front due to their design.

**SAPI cut**: standard way to cut ballistic plates. Used by military plates. Top corners are clipped at a 45° angle.

**Shooter cut** (also: **shooter's cut**): similar to SAPI cut, but with the bottom corners also clipped (to a smaller degree). Trades off a bit of coverage for a bit of increased mobility overall.

**Swimmer cut** (also: **swimmer's cut**): a cut with a sharper angle for top corner clipping. Trades off some coverage for increased shoulder/arm mobility.

#### Curvature

**Single-curve**: standard curvature of a ballistic plate. Relatively-cheap to produce.

**Multi-curve**: advanced curvature. Fits better with the body, removing hot spots and reducing discomfort.
