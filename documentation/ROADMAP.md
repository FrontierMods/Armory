# Roadmap

## Future

## v1.1

- [ ] **new types of holsters/sheaths**
  - [ ] `BOOT_HOLSTER`: for use with large boots and subcompact pistols
  - [ ] `BOOT_CLIP`: for use with large-ish boots and knives/tools
  - [ ] `WAISTBAND_TUCK`: concealable holsters

## Current

## v1.0

- [x] **remodel** (most of the) **existing equipment**

## v0.3

- [ ] **deconstructable / reconstructable chest rigs**
  - some chest rigs are just a QASM-interface panel on a harness
  - deconstructing those would yield the appropriate type of panel and the harness
  - harnesses could be cut for nylon or reassembled into a separate chest rig with another panel
  - QASM panels can fit to some of the slicker plate carriers, thus adding extra PALS webbing and/or preset pouches

## v0.2

- [ ] **remodel ballistic vests**
- [ ] **remodel ballistic plates**
  - [ ] ceramic plates degrade after each shot, rather than break immediately
  - [ ] 4× military sizes of plates (S, M, L, XL)
  - [ ] 2× commercial sizes of plates (8″ × 10″, 10″ × 12″)

## v0.1

- [x] **remodel chest rigs**
  - [x] tactical vests
  - [x] chest rigs
  - [x] load-bearing vests

## To Be Determined

- [ ] **properly-modular outfits**
  - i.e. being able to attach independent pieces of an armor set
  - postponed due to not having the engine capacity in the latest stable
- [ ] **ICW ballistic plates**
  - hard plates that require external soft backer plates to achieve their ballistic rating
  - to be investigated
