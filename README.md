# Armory

_Armory_ (`armory`) expands your character's choice of military, riot, police, and militia outfits and equipment.

In particular, grounds existing equipment in reality by providing them with real names, dimensions, and properties (coverage, protection, breathability etc.), and adds distinct options for each class of items, to provide players with a better choice depending on situation requirements.

Requires [Frontiers _Core_](https://github.com/FrontierMods/Core).
